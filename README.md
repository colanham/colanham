I'm currently a C.S. undergrad at the University of Georgia (go dawgs!). I'm pursuing options within software development, information technology, data analyzation, and all things technical. I'm especially interested in developing and building ethical technologies serving to improve our lives, not take away from them. I'm still learning so I hope that this helps to show what types of things I'm interested and working on.
